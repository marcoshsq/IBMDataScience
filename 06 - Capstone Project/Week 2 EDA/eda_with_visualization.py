# **SpaceX  Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction**

## Assignment: Exploring and Preparing Data

Estimated time needed: **70** minutes

In this assignment, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is due to the fact that SpaceX can reuse the first stage.

In this lab, you will perform Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering.

Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully

Several examples of an unsuccessful landing are shown here:

Most unsuccessful landings are planned. Space X performs a controlled landing in the oceans.

## Objectives

Perform exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering using `Pandas` and `Matplotlib`

*   Exploratory Data Analysis
*   Preparing Data  Feature Engineering

### Import Libraries and Define Auxiliary Functions

We will import the following libraries the lab
"""

# andas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
import pandas as pd
#NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays
import numpy as np
# Matplotlib is a plotting library for python and pyplot gives us a MatLab like plotting framework. We will use this in our plotter function to plot data.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics
import seaborn as sns

"""## Exploratory Data Analysis

First, let's read the SpaceX dataset into a Pandas dataframe and print its summary
"""

#df=pd.read_csv("https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DS0321EN-SkillsNetwork/datasets/dataset_part_2.csv")

# If you were unable to complete the previous lab correctly you can uncomment and load this csv

df = pd.read_csv('https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/api/dataset_part_2.csv')

df.head(5)

"""First, let's try to see how the `FlightNumber` (indicating the continuous launch attempts.) and `Payload` variables would affect the launch outcome.

We can plot out the <code>FlightNumber</code> vs. <code>PayloadMass</code>and overlay the outcome of the launch. We see that as the flight number increases, the first stage is more likely to land successfully. The payload mass is also important; it seems the more massive the payload, the less likely the first stage will return.

"""

plt.ylabel("Pay load Mass (kg)",fontsize=20)
plt.show()

Next, let's drill down to each site visualize its detailed launch records.

### TASK 1: Visualize the relationship between Flight Number and Launch Site

Use the function <code>catplot</code> to plot <code>FlightNumber</code> vs <code>LaunchSite</code>, set the  parameter <code>x</code>  parameter to <code>FlightNumber</code>,set the  <code>y</code> to <code>Launch Site</code> and set the parameter <code>hue</code> to <code>'class'</code>

plt.ylabel("Launch Site",fontsize=20)
plt.show()

"""Now try to explain the patterns you found in the Flight Number vs. Launch Site scatter point plots.

### TASK 2: Visualize the relationship between Payload and Launch Site

We also want to observe if there is any relationship between launch sites and their payload mass.

plt.ylabel("Pay load Mass (kg)",fontsize=20)

"""Now try to explain any patterns you found in the Payload Vs. Launch Site scatter point chart.

### TASK  3: Visualize the relationship between success rate of each orbit type

Next, we want to visually check if there are any relationship between success rate and orbit type.

Let's create a `bar chart` for the sucess rate of each orbit
"""

# HINT use groupby method on Orbit column and get the mean of Class column

### TASK  4: Visualize the relationship between FlightNumber and Orbit type

For each orbit, we want to see if there is any relationship between FlightNumber and Orbit type.

plt.ylabel("Orbit",fontsize=20)
plt.show()

"""You should see that in the LEO orbit the Success appears related to the number of flights; on the other hand, there seems to be no relationship between flight number when in GTO orbit.

### TASK  5: Visualize the relationship between Payload and Orbit type

Similarly, we can plot the Payload vs. Orbit scatter point charts to reveal the relationship between Payload and Orbit type
"""

# Plot a scatter point chart with x axis to be Payload and y axis to be the Orbit, and hue to be the class value

plt.ylabel("Orbit",fontsize=20)
plt.show()

"""You should observe that Heavy payloads have a negative influence on GTO orbits and positive on GTO and Polar LEO (ISS) orbits.

### TASK  6: Visualize the launch success yearly trend

You can plot a line chart with x axis to be <code>Year</code> and y axis to be average success rate, to get the average launch success trend.

The function will help you get the year from the date:
"""

# A function to Extract years from the date 
def Extract_year(year):
    for i in df["Date"]:
        year.append(i.split("-")[0])
    return year

year = []
df["year"] = Extract_year(year)
df["Success Rate"] = df["Class"] * 100
sns.lineplot(data = df, x = "year", y = "Success Rate")

"""you can observe that the sucess rate since 2013 kept increasing till 2020

## Features Engineering

By now, you should obtain some preliminary insights about how each important variable would affect the success rate, we will select the features that will be used in success prediction in the future module.
"""

features = df[['FlightNumber', 'PayloadMass', 'Orbit', 'LaunchSite', 'Flights', 'GridFins', 'Reused', 'Legs', 'LandingPad', 'Block', 'ReusedCount', 'Serial']]
features.head()

"""### TASK  7: Create dummy variables to categorical columns

Use the function <code>get_dummies</code> and <code>features</code> dataframe to apply OneHotEncoder to the column <code>Orbits</code>, <code>LaunchSite</code>, <code>LandingPad</code>, and <code>Serial</code>. Assign the value to the variable <code>features_one_hot</code>, display the results using the method head. Your result dataframe must include all features including the encoded ones.
"""

# HINT: Use get_dummies() function on the categorical columns
oh_orbit = pd.get_dummies(features["Orbit"])
oh_launch = pd.get_dummies(features["LaunchSite"])
oh_landing = pd.get_dummies(features["LandingPad"])
oh_serial = pd.get_dummies(features["Serial"])
remainder = features[["FlightNumber","PayloadMass", "Flights", "GridFins", "Reused", "Legs", "Block","ReusedCount"]]
features_one_hot = pd.concat([oh_launch, oh_landing, oh_serial, oh_orbit], axis=1)
features_one_hot.head()

"""### TASK  8: Cast all numeric columns to `float64`

Now that our <code>features_one_hot</code> dataframe only contains numbers cast the entire dataframe to variable type <code>float64</code>
"""

# HINT: use astype function
features_one_hot.astype('float64')

"""We can now export it to a <b>CSV</b> for the next section,but to make the answers consistent, in the next lab we will provide data in a pre-selected date range.
