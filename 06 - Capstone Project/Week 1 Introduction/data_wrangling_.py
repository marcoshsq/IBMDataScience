# **Space X  Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction**

## Lab 2: Data wrangling

Estimated time needed: **60** minutes

In this lab, we will perform some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find some patterns in the data and determine what would be the label for training supervised models.

In the data set, there are several different cases where the booster did not land successfully. Sometimes a landing was attempted but failed due to an accident; for example, <code>True Ocean</code> means the mission outcome was successfully  landed to a specific region of the ocean while <code>False Ocean</code> means the mission outcome was unsuccessfully landed to a specific region of the ocean. <code>True RTLS</code> means the mission outcome was successfully  landed to a ground pad <code>False RTLS</code> means the mission outcome was unsuccessfully landed to a ground pad.<code>True ASDS</code> means the mission outcome was successfully landed on  a drone ship <code>False ASDS</code> means the mission outcome was unsuccessfully landed on a drone ship.

In this lab we will mainly convert those outcomes into Training Labels with `1` means the booster successfully landed `0` means it was unsuccessful.

Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully

*   <b>LEO</b>: Low Earth orbit (LEO)is an Earth-centred orbit with an altitude of 2,000 km (1,200 mi) or less (approximately one-third of the radius of Earth),\[1] or with at least 11.25 periods per day (an orbital period of 128 minutes or less) and an eccentricity less than 0.25.\[2] Most of the manmade objects in outer space are in LEO <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDS0321ENSkillsNetwork26802033-2021-01-01'>\[1]</a>.

Operating in these orbits can provide a number of benefits to Earth observation spacecraft as the spacecraft operates closer to the observation<a href='https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271499606_Very_Low_Earth_Orbit_mission_concepts_for_Earth_Observation_Benefits_and_challenges?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDS0321ENSkillsNetwork26802033-2021-01-01'>\[2]</a>.

*   <b>GTO</b> A geosynchronous orbit is a high Earth orbit that allows satellites to match Earth's rotation. Located at 22,236 miles (35,786 kilometers) above Earth's equator, this position is a valuable spot for monitoring weather, communications and surveillance. Because the satellite orbits at the same speed that the Earth is turning, the satellite seems to stay in place over a single longitude, though it may drift north to south,” NASA wrote on its Earth Observatory website <a  href="https://www.space.com/29222-geosynchronous-orbit.html?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDS0321ENSkillsNetwork26802033-2021-01-01" >\[3] </a>.
